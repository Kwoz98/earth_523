# Analysis for Earth523

This is my first time writing in **RMarkdown**. I learned that this document is a mixture of code and writing that can be seen in an html document online. Marian used RMarkdown to create her Rpubs webpage. 

Visit my github page here: https://github.com/Kwoz98/earth_523. I still need to learn how to embed the link into words. [] followed by (website) doesn't work for me.

My repository on my computer is git_repos and I have an earth folder. These changes can be pushed into the master version online.
